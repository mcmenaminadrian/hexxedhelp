:title Blocks
:label block

In many cases it helps to partition addresses into the form block:offset rather than use a linear address. Hexxed supports using this form of address and it is also supported in the <<navigating|navigation commands>>.

The default block size is 512 octets (bytes) - ie., ::0x200:: but an arbitrary size can be chosen.
